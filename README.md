# Pokémon Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project explores the Pokémon dataset from Kaggle to build machine learning models for various tasks.

## Dataset
- Source: [Pokémon Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alopez247/pokemon)
- Description: Contains information about different Pokémon, including their names, types, stats, abilities, etc.

## Project Goals
- Explore the dataset and identify patterns and insights.
- Build a model to predict a Pokémon's primary type based on its stats.
- Optionally, group similar Pokémon using clustering algorithms.
- Optionally, build a model to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary or not.

## Setup Instructions
1.  Clone the repository using `git clone [your-repo-url]`.
2.  Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed with necessary packages (see dependencies below).
3. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` *(we will generate this file later)*
4.  Place the `pokemon.csv` file in the `data` folder.
5.  Run the Jupyter Notebooks from the `notebooks` folder.

## Project Structure
- data: Raw dataset files.
- notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualizations.
- src: Python scripts for any data processing or model building (optional).
- docs: Additional documentation or reports (optional).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- polars
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- jupyter notebook

## Next Steps
1.  Start exploring the data.
2.  Add to the Data Dictionary section as we move forward.
3.  Start creating the first notebook.
